BRUTEFORCE  -   O(N^2)      -   O(1)
GREEDY      -   O(N)        -   O(1)



----- ROUGH NOTES WHILE BRAIN STORMING ----

if list in descending order, no profit can be made

if list in ascending order, profit - a[n]-a[0]


APPROACH 1 -
[7,1,5,3,6,4]

total maxprof = 0;
iterate for each element - take one and consider that u bought on that day
	maxprof = 0
	iterate for i+1 - see the num and see if this prof is > max prof. ( we dont need to check previous ones as its invalid to sell before its bought)
		reasign max prof
	totalmaxprof = maxprof > totalmaxprof ? maxprof : totalmaxprof


APPROACH 2 -
[7,1,5,3,6,4]

total maxprof = 0;
initial buy point = arr[0]
iterate from index 1 -
	if arr[i] < initial buy point
			initial buy point = arr[i]
	else
		 total maxprof = arr[i] - initial buy point > total maxprof ? arr[i] - initial buy point : total maxprof
return total maxprof



it 2
initial buy point = 1
total maxprof = 4

it 3
initial buy point = 1
total maxprof = 4

It4
initial buy point = 1
total max prof = 5

IT5
initial buy point = 1
total max prof = 5
